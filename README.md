# Space Launches

Hello, my name is Amin and this is my first ever attempt at creating an R Shiny application, which you can access [here](https://aminramlan.shinyapps.io/Space_Launches/).

The app enables the user to gain information about a few things including:

- Space launch activities around the world in all countries between 1957 and 2018
- Space launches in specific countries or space agencies involved.
- Vehicle and mission names used in the space launches
- Seasonal trends in space launch activities that might be present for each year

The dataset was obtained from the official [tidytuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) (week 3 of 2019).

More details on the dataset can be found [here](data/2019/2019-01-15/launches.csv).
